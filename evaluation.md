# Evaluation plan

We will evaluate the outcome of this project in the following ways:

- Community Engagement: the number of teams submitting models will be used to evaluate our engagment and outreach effectiveness.
- Ease of Submission: By the end of the project, the submission process and return of model performance results will be used to evaluated the Synapse system.
- Pipeline Evaluation: Successfully testing Docker models on the NCATS cloud infrastructure and then running those docker models on on-prem UW environments will mark the success of the pilot EHR DREAM challenge study.
