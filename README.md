# Patient mortality prediction DREAM Challenge
Before this example repo, team members had a hard time understanding the expectations for what the repo and associated milestones should look like. This repo provides a concrete (though abstracted) instantiation and provides an introductory Github tutorial for project management purposes. 

This "project" will be evaluated on the basis of how easily it is understood by members of the CD2H team who need to make their own similar repositories. 

## Problem statement
Please include a Project Statement on your landing page. Your problem statement should be in the form of: What can CTSAs/the community not do now, that would be addressed by this project's success? A problem statement should be a clear vision and the overall method that will be used to solve the problem at hand. 

## Project description
DREAM challenges are an instrumental tool for harnessing the wisdom of the broader scientific community to develop computational solutions to biomedical problems. While previous DREAM challenges have worked with complex biological data as well as sensitive medical data, running DREAM Challenges with Electronic Health Records present unique complications. While previous challenges developed techniques to facilitate model to data approaches to maintain the privacy of the data, ensuring that the EHR data is of a specific quality is important for a challenge. EHR data is also more complicated than the data previously used in model to data approaches. We will be using the OMOP data standard to make development of models standardized, but even with a standardized and well documented dataset, complications can arise when facilitating the model development and submission from multiple parties.

## Team members 

Include any members considered part of the project team - internal to CD2H sites and community members.

see https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/tree/master/team.md

## Repositories

List Github repositories associated with the project. Each project requires at least one repository to house the administrative tracking and public information. You can either add this information to an existing repository, or create a new one and list the associated repositories below. Please be sure to tag any repositories not under the data2health organization with the topic 'data2health'. Project repositories must be public. Some repositories may be private for sensitivity or operational reasons. 

Example repos:
- https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template
- https://github.com/data2health/operations; private repo editable by members of team @data2health/ops

## Deliverables
Each project should propose one or more deliverables. Examples: a released code package, a best practices document, a final survey, a set of survey results, etc.

## Milestones 
Each deliverable is represented as a Milestone, but not all Milestones need be deliverables. For example, see this 'report on XYZ' is a [Deliverable Milestone](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/milestone/2)

Please create 4-8 Milestones for each project, with dates prior to August 31st.  Milestones for partially completed deliverables are acceptable: beta release of software, # interviews performed, 75% coverage, etc. 

Each Milestone must have at least one Issue (aka 'ticket'), each issue should be assigned to a person, preferably one at a time; reassignments are fine. Issues with checklists showing degree of completion are also acceptable, see [example](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/2).

Github help on Milestones is [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/)

## Evaluation
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. Please invite any participants to [onboard](http://bit.ly/cd2h-onboarding-form)

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in Github using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
[Documentating projects in Github](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)

[The project Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vLp-H32KTNobiZF2cK82At90S6dVJNUf) is accessible to onboarded participants. 

## Slack room
[The project slack room](https://cd2h.slack.com/messages/C9D9SQWEQ) is accessible to onboarded participants.
